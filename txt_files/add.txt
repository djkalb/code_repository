add takes in a list of command line args 

needs to bind information from console to instance of algorithm -- add that to dB
-- somehow autofill as much information as possible
-- pull last addition and keep as many fields as possible - make user verify them though - flag to keep all settings cept descr and code
need to either make gui or go back to shell so descr can be copied in -- shouldnt be too hard
-- grab user id from settings.py / config file

FLAGS
    -h display add info -> all other flags 
    -r repeat all info from last submission minus descr and code_body and specified command line args 
    -v or view -> opens a gui to make it easier -- not immediate
    -l: <language> 
    -d: <description>
    -c pulls the code body from the clipboard
