repos is a console app designed to add and search code algorithms and other helpful tools.
            accepted arguments are add, search, config, view, and -h for help which can be called for each method individually. 
            call repos search <search>, <language> etc. can only call one function at a timeadd takes in a list of command line args 

needs to bind information from console to instance of algorithm -- add that to dB
-- somehow autofill as much information as possible
-- pull last addition and keep as many fields as possible - make user verify them though - flag to keep all settings cept descr and code
need to either make gui or go back to shell so descr can be copied in -- shouldnt be too hard
-- grab user id from settings.py / config file

FLAGS
    -h display add info -> all other flags 
    -r repeat all info from last submission minus descr and code_body and specified command line args 
    -v or view -> opens a gui to make it easier -- not immediate
    -l: <language> 
    -d: <description>
    -c pulls the code body from the clipboard

--Basic functionality is working
	-needs data validation very badly
	-the -r flag needs to wait until working with permanent dB -- can use seed data for initial test
	-need to add seed data to models class for testing 
	-add user interaction - make sure a user is attached to every addition to dB 
	the clean description will have to wait until i build the search, so it can just call the search 
	
receives list of arguments executes all of them -instance is created from info --Needs a test to find missing information and allow user to add that info in
from inside the console app no need to go back to terminal / previews info to make sure it is correct displays a portion of code_base to verify it is correct
